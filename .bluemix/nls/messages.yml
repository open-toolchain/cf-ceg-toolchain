template.name: "Develop a Bluemix app using IBM Whitewater and Cloud Foundry integrated with Service Manifest Runtime Libraries"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy a Cloud Foundry application, sourced from IBM Whitewater GitHub Enterprise. By default, the toolchain clones a sample Node.js “Hello World” app into a GHE repo, which you can then modify.  This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery through staging (YS1) and prod (YP), source control, issue tracking, Devops Insights and online editing.\n\nThe toolchain also includes a second delivery pipeline that is used to add the manifest runtime libraries that are necessary to adhere to the IBM Watson Cloud Service Contract.\n\nThe toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.  If an instance of that service isn’t already in your organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
template.gettingStarted: "**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment. Check the pipeline to see it progressing through staging and production. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tutorial_toolchain_cfv2?task=2) for this toolchain."

sc.longDescription: "The service manifest contains metadata of your service in accordance with the actual version of the Service Contract. After successful registration of your service manifest you should check the following Web Page if the registration was successful and if the manifest meets the actual compliancy requirements.\n\nFor more information see:\n\n [Sevice Manifest Documentation](https://github.ibm.com/CloudTools/manifest-runtime-production/blob/master/README.md)\n\n [Service Manifest Specifications](https://github.ibm.com/CloudTools/manifest-runtime-production#details-of-the-servicemanifest-json)"
sc.toolDescription: "A fundamental principle of our Squad and Tribe system is that the Squad is the primary unit of decision-making. This is intended to greatly empower the squads to decide how to most effectively work together to deliver and operate their services.  The Service Contract establishes the guidelines that all squads and services must follow as they decide how to deliver and operate their sevices."
sc.manifestServiceName: "For Bluemix Services, this is the canonical service name as represented in the Bluemix Catalog. cf marketplace will return the list of services. For other services, you can decide on the appropriate name (i.e. IBM Container Service has chosen 'containers'). Once chosen, this should not change as it represents the public interface name for the service the component is part of."
