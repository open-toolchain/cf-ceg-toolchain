# Get started with Cloud Foundry, IBM Whitewater, and IBM Watson Cloud service contract

### Continuously deliver a Cloud Foundry app with IBM Whitewater GHE and integrated IBM Watson Cloud serivce manifest runtime libraries

![Toolchain image](.bluemix/toolchain.png)

This template will configure a toolchain that can:
* perform rolling deploys through Bluemix stage1 (YS1) and then to Bluemix prod (YP).
* provide cognitive insights to learn where you most need to improve your developer productivity, code quality, and delivery cycle times; as well as provide quality gates that will stop a deploy that doesnâ€™t cut the mustard.
* track code deployments back to GHE commits and issues
* notify about delivery process in Slack
* allows to edit code online with WebIDE (but you can use desktop tools at your preference)
* enable the required 
runtime libraries for the Watson Cloud Engineering Service Contract

#### Manifest Runtime Libraries

The Cloud Engineering Guild provides a set of runtime libraries that are used to generate a CRNs ( Cloud Resource Name ) for your application.  The CRN is used to uniquely identify each instance of a running application on Bluemix in addition to 

These libraries are added to your toolchain and enabled in your application as follows:

* A second pipeline is created to add, in a new branch, the required libraries to your repository.
    > Note that the pipeline must be run manually.  You can change this to run automatically if needed however you will need to merge the changes to the `master` branch before they are enabled for your application.

* The runtime manifest template is generated and customized for your application
* All the changes are added as a new branch.  All you need to do is create the pull request and merge the changes

After the new branch is merged, your application will now contain the following:
  * `manifest` directory with the required files
  * `libibmmanifest.tar.gz` which contains the compiled files
  * `.profile` used to enable the objects when your application is launched

Most of the properties used in the mainifest are derived from your applicaton and toolchain names.  Those can be updated **before** creating your toolchain.  The property `REGION_ID` used in the `STAGING` and `PROD` stages of your pipeline needs to match the region your application is being deployed to.

Periodically, the Cloud Engineering Guild will update the runtime libraries and you will need to incorporate them into your build and deploy process.

You can run the `Manifest Runtime` pipeline to add the new changes to your repository.  Simply run the pipeline, create a pull request, and merge into your application.
